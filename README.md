This is a few sentences about me, so I start with who am I? I'm 16 years old who lives in Czech Republic (small country in the Central Europe). 
I am mainly fullstack web developer and SW engineer but I like try new technologies including other focus. 
I have over 6 years experience as a web developer (PHP - Nette Framework, html&css) and over four years experience in JavaScript (React, TS, Node.js...) and Java.
